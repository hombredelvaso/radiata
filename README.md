#### TODO
- build out single div, add parent nav and sibling div
- browserify into single file including css
- settings OR keyword for type of spread
- make delegation... add even if element isnt on page yet?
- choose between hover/click, etc...
- another variation, follow mouse (open at coordinates on key press)
- use: http://github.e-sites.nl/perimeter.js/ instead of mouseover/mouseout
